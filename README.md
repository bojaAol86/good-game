# Was-it-a-good-game

This web app is mainly for people living outside the US, that are interested in US sports.
Many times, the games are broadcasted in uncomforatble hours, in the middle of the night,
and you can't watch the game live.

Many times you want to watch a game, a good game, not a specific one.
But, how do you know if what you are going to see is a Good Game?

Maybe it was boring, and over within the first minutes, and the rest was garbage time?
Maybe there was a better game, with triple OOT, and record breaking scoring?

And you missed it!
And instead, you watched some boring game..

Here you can check last night's games, by categories:

Green - It was a good game
Red - It was a bad game
Yellow - The game is In progress or Scheduled.

Check it out, and enjoy they best game possible :)
